# Project for C++ course "Balls"

This project was developed for a C++ course, utilizing a taught concepts.

## Game Description

"Balls" is a game where the player, represented by a green square, aims to score as many points as possible. Points are collected by gathering multicolored circles that randomly appear on the map. However, beware of red balls with a white outline! These balls deduct 1HP from the player's health pool, which starts at 10HP at the beginning of the game. Fortunately, there are also healing balls, represented as green circles with a white outline. Each healing ball restores 1HP, healing the player up to the initial HP value.

## Implementation

The game is written in C++ and is based on the SFML library.
